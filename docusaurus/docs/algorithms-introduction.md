# Algorithms 

Algorithms are a set of instructions or rules designed to solve a specific 
problem. They are the building blocks of computer programs and are essential 
for solving complex computational problems efficiently. Algorithms can be 
implemented in various programming languages and are used in a wide range of 
applications, such as search engines, social media platforms, and e-commerce 
websites. There are many `Main` algorithms for solving specific problems:

- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming

In this section you will find all my notes and insights about the Algorithms:
