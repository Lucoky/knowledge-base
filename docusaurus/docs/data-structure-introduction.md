# Data Structure

Data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. It is
an essential aspect of computer science that deals with the design and implementation of algorithms for organizing
and managing data. Data structures are used to represent and manipulate data in various forms, such as arrays,  
linked lists, trees, graphs, and more.
